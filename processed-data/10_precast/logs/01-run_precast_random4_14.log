PRECAST :  An efficient data integration method is provided for multiple spatial transcriptomics data with non-cluster-relevant effects such as the complex batch effects. It unifies spatial factor analysis simultaneously with spatial clustering and embedding alignment, requiring only partially shared cell/domain clusters across datasets. More details can be referred to Wei Liu, et al. (2023) <doi:10.1038/s41467-023-35947-w>.   Check out our Package website (https://feiyoung.github.io/PRECAST/index.html) for a more complete description of the methods and analyses
